  <p>Depth-First Search</p>

<p>Recommended reading: <a href="/blog/bfs.html">Breadth-First Search</a></p>

<h1>Overview:</h1>

<p>
  I will assume, here, that you are familiar with the Breadth-First Search
  (BFS).  If you recall, the BFS is so named because it widens its search in the
  graph as far as possible before going any deeper. As you might expect, the
  Depth-First Search (DFS) does the opposite! Even though it uses the opposite
  strategy to the BFS, DFS can still be used for many of the same purposes. For
  example, DFS can also be used to check if a graph is connected. However, DFS
  is not a good algorithm for finding any shortest paths! To understand why,
  think about what it means to traverse a graph "depth-first": the algorithm
  will select a path, and then follow that path until its end before starting
  down a new path. So, if we use the DFS, it might select the <em>longest</em>
  possible path to a vertex first! Of course, it may also select the shortest
  path, or any path in between.
</p>

<p>
  So, if DFS can do <em>some</em> of the things BFS can do, but not <em>all</em>
  of them, what is the point of it? Why would we bother with it at all if it is
  the weaker tool? The answer, obviously, is that it is not a weaker tool, and
  has its own special strengths. One of the very nice things about the DFS is
  that it can be easily implemented <em>recursively</em>. This is very nice
  indeed! DFS is also very useful because it can be used to find lots of
  important information about a graph's structure that is more difficult with a
  BFS; for example, detecting cycles. Many of the other reasons to keep DFS
  around will become apparent in more advanced algorithms, for which DFS serves
  as a starting point.
</p>

<p>
  So, how might we go about doing a DFS? As stated above, a DFS can be
  implemented recursively, as follows:
</p>

<pre><code>
    function dfs(G = (V, E), s):
      for each edge (s, u) in E:
        if u is not visited:
          mark u as visited
          dfs(G, u)
        end if
      end for
    end function
</pre></code>

<p>
  A very simple recursive function! Almost half of it is just "end [whatever]"!
  It's quite straightforward to see what this is doing: start at some vertex,
  and for each of the edges leaving it, do everything over again with the next
  vertex as the start! And as it recurses, it marks each vertex that it has
  visited so that it does not repeat itself. Easy!
