Let's say, by some miraculous turn of events, that you have a problem which can
be modelled as a graph! And let's say this problem involves finding the shortest
distance between two vertices on this graph. Then a good place to start would be
with a Breadth-First Search, or BFS.
</p>

<p>
BFS is one of the simplest graph algorithms, but understanding it is important
since it is a conceptual stepping-stone to more intricate ones.
</p>

<h1>Overview:</h1>

<p>
The idea behind BFS is that it starts at some initial vertex in the graph and
works its way out from this vertex to all others, level by level. That is, all
vertices of distance d from the start vertex will get visited before any
vertices of distance <var>d</var> + 1. By working its way out level by level,
BFS is guaranteed to find, for every vertex, the shortest possible path from the
starting point. Another way to think about this level-by-level traversal of the
graph is that it expands the <em>width</em> of the search as far as possible
before expanding the <em>depth</em> of the search. This is where the name comes
from!
</p>

// Put an animation here!
<div class="animation" id="animation" style="background: #ddd;">
</div>

<h1>Pseudocode:</h1>

<p>
The basic pseudocode for this algorithm is as follows:
</p>

<pre><code>
1 bfs( (V, E), s ):
2   for each vertex v in V:
3     mark v as not visited
4   end for

5   mark s as visited
6   add s to queue

7   while queue is not empty:
8     remove a vertex v from queue

9     for each vertex u adjacent to v:
10      if u is not visited:
11        mark u as visited
12        add u to queue
13      end if
14    end for
15  end while
</code></pre>

<p>
Lines 2 to 4 serve only to set up the starting conditions for the search; before
the search begins, each vertex must not be considered as <em>visited</em>, until
it actually has been visited.
</p>

<p>
Lines 5 and 6 add the starting vertex to the queue and mark it as visited.
Vertices are marked as <em>visited</em> when they are added to the queue. This
is done so that the algorithm does not add a vertex to the queue more than once.
</p>

<p>
The interesting part happens on line 7 and afterwards. The loop will iterate
until queue is empty. At the beginning, the queue has only the starting vertex,
<var>s</var>. So on line 8, <var>s</var> gets removed from the queue and
assigned to <var>v</var>. Now the loop on line 9 iterates through each vertex
that is connected to <var>v</var> (i.e. <var>s</var>, at this point). Each of
these vertices is added to the queue and marked as visited. When the loop has
finished, or terminated, all of the vertices adjacent to <var>s</var> have been
added to the queue, and line 7 gets executed again. This time, on line 8, the
first vertex that was adjacent to <var>s</var> gets removed and the process gets
repeated.
</p>

<p>
What is crucial to the understanding of how the algorithm works is an
understanding of how queues work. After the first iteration of the
<em>while</em> loop, when the starting vertex was processed, all of the vertices
adjacent to the starting vertex are in the queue. This means that all vertices
added to the queue later will be processed last. This is the fundamental
property that makes the BFS work. Because of this property, we can see that each
'level' of the graph gets traversed before the next 'level'.
</p>

<p>
The above pseudocode gives the structure for BFS, but notice that it does not
actually <em>do</em> anything. Each vertex is traversed in the order required by
the BFS but nothing is done when the vertex is visited. So! Let's remedy this.
</p>

<pre><code>
1 bfs( (V, E), s ):
2   for each vertex v in V:
3     mark v as not visited
4     distance[v] = 0
5   end for

6   mark s as visited
7   add s to queue

8   while queue is not empty:
9     remove a vertex v from queue

10    for each vertex u adjacent to v:
11      if u is not visited:
12        distance[u] = distance[v] + 1
13        mark u as visited
14        add u to queue
15      end if
16    end for
17  end while
</code></pre>

<p>
The differences are on lines 4, 12, and 18. The purpose of these additions is
to calculate the distance of each vertex from <var>s</var>. The important bit
happens on line 12. This does what we want it to because of the properties that
we established above; namely, the property that each level of the graph gets
traversed before the next. Since each level has the same distance from
<var>s</var>, this means that all the nodes that are of distance <var>d</var>
from <var>s</var> are processed before any nodes of distance <var>d + 1</var>.
So when line 12 is reached for some vertex <var>u</var>, we know two things:
that <var>u</var> has not yet been added to the queue, and that <var>u</var> is
farther away from <var>s</var> than <var>v</var>. So when <var>distance[u]</var>
is assigned the value of <var>distance[v] + 1</var>, we know that this is the
shortest possible distance from <var>s</var> to <var>v</var>!
</p>

<p>
But what if this isn't enough for us? We don't want to know only the distance
from <var>s</var>, we want to know how to get from <var>s</var> to the vertex!
Another small change to the algorithm will let us do this as well.
</p>

<pre><code>
1 bfs( (V, E), s ):
2   for each vertex v in V:
3     mark v as not visited
4     distance[v] = 0
5     predecessor[v] = null
6   end for

7   mark s as visited
8   add s to queue

9   while queue is not empty:
10    remove a vertex v from queue

11    for each vertex u adjacent to v:
12      if u is not visited:
13        distance[u] = distance[v] + 1
14        predecessor[u] = v
15        mark u as visited
16        add u to queue
17      end if
18    end for
19  end while
</code></pre>

<p>
The differences here are on lines 5 and 14. Line 14 assigns <var>v</var> to be
the <em>predecessor</em> of <var>u</var>.
